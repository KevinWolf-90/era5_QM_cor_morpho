This brief documentation accompanies the two manuscripts: 
1. "Correction of temperature and relative humidity biases in ERA5 by bivariate quantile mapping: Implications for contrail classification."
and
2. "Morphology and temporal and spatial distribution of non-persistent and persistent contrail formation areas in ERA5",
which are / will both be submitted to the journal Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics [(ACP)](https://www.atmospheric-chemistry-and-physics.net/)
